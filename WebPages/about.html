    <h2> About Devin Graupmann</h2>

    <p>
        As far back as I can remember, I have been on stage. I was 10 months old when I remember my first magic comedy show. 
        I was holding two sticks and wearing a Lady Gaga helmet at the Granite Falls Library while Alex Zerbe, two-time Guinness World Record winner, 
        spun three globes on each point. Everyone cheered as I held the spinning globes high in the air. 
        An hour and 45 minutes later I was asked to come on stage with Matt Baker, three-time Guinness World Record winner, at the Monroe Library. 
        It was the same trick. I stood there holding the three spinning globes high in the air while everyone cheered. I was hooked. 

    </p>

    <p>
        There was always a show going on at the library. While other people went to the library for books, I would go to see the shows. 
        I went on stage with Tim Noah, eight-time Emmy Award Winner, and his assistant Cyndi Soup, so many times that I have their moves memorized. 
        I can do the Wow, Wow, Wibble, Wobble, Wozzie, Woodle, Woo in my sleep. 
        I was greeted when I entered through the door by name, given a big hug, and was almost always picked to go on stage. 
        I sang his songs “I Can Do Anything” and “Super Kid” until I could sing all the words on stage. 
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    Around four years old, I met Jeff Evans at the library. He invited me to go to The Washington School Assembly Showcase, 
    sent me a magic DVD, and taught me my first paper clip magic trick.  
    “Razzle, dazzle, diesel, dip, paper clip, jump and flip.”
               It was the first trick I used to make money. I’d say, “If you give me a dollar, I’ll show you a magic trick”. 
               A lot of people handed me a dollar. After a few times, I asked for a $5, $10, $20, or as high as they would like to go for a magic trick. 
               It worked. People would give me money and I would perform magic for them. 
    
    <p>
        I started to go to the restaurants to perform at the tables. 
        The managers gave me food to eat and people gave me tips. 
        I remember juggling hats at one restaurant and two men at the table stopped eating to show me their hat tricks. 
        The manager came out to shake my hand. He paid for my meal, gave me extra food, gave me two certificates for future meals, 
        and asked me to come back. Every time, I went to a restaurant I would get paid. 

    </p>

    <p>
        Around 5 years old, I joined “The Northwest Ring of Smoke” and “The Ring of Fire” magic club. 
        I found out about the PCAM, SAM, and FISM competitions. I decided I wanted to compete, so I started practicing. 
        I found “The Vampire Rose” online and started practicing. I also rewrote “The Lover’s Gift”. The story was originally five lines. 
        I had an eight-minute production by the time I was done rewriting the story “The Lover’s Gift” and added in all my magic tricks. 
        Everyone cheered as I practiced. I practiced again and again until I had the shows memorized. 
        I was able to project over loud cars, draw a crowd, and people would give me money. 
    </p>

    <p>
        My money originally went towards earning enough to pay for PCAM. 
        After I earned enough for the competition, I put my money back into my business. 
        I paid for gas, parking, new magic props as my used ones became old, and put my money in a bank account for later use. 
        I wrote up a business plan with costs versus expenses. I also donated part of my money to causes. 
        I donated three months of salary to the families devastated by the Oso slide in Arlington, Washington. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I’d make about $400 a day when I performed. I made The Magic of Devin Graupmann business cards. 
        People started asking me to do birthday parties, weddings, business events, baby showers, and festivals. 
        I started out making $150 - $200 for a 20 - 30 minute show. There were times when I did three shows in a day. 
        There were also days when I had no performances. I would practice at poetry nights, RASP, open mics, and elderly homes. 
    </p>

    <p>
        On my days off, I’d go to the libraries. There was always a show. 
        I’d go on stage to help people like Louie Foxx, two-time Guinness Award winner. 
        Eric Ode, Emmy Award winner, children entertainer, and published author. Nancy Stewart, multiple Parent Choice Award winner. 
        I’d always leave excited and ready to get back to performing my own shows. 

    </p>

    <p>
        I finished creating two shows for the Pacific Coast Association of Magicians (PCAM) & The Society of American Magicians (SAM) competition. 
        The first show was for the stage magic competition. The second show was for the close-up competition. 
        The shows were 7 – 8 minutes. I practiced a lot. 

    </p>
            

    <p>
        Jeff Evans invited me to make a magic DVD with him. He would perform the trick and I was his assistant. 
        We made three videos together. He paid me $100 plus for my time. I performed in Canada on YTV.com. 
        I was paid. Later, I was in Wizards Aren’t Real. It was a one-day gig and $100 didn’t feel like much money for a whole day of work. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Anytime, I wanted to I could go to the library and see the people I worked with. 
        I once watched eight library shows in one day. I was in every single show. 
        One of my favorite magicians to watch was Thomas Pruiksma and Mike Dobias. 
        Thomas Pruiksma performed Poet’s Magic. He was calm, articulate, and had a way of weaving a spell over his audience. 
        Everyone walked out the door very mellow and talked about how beautiful the day was. His voice made everyone very calm. 
        He used the word beautiful multiple times. Mike Dobias performed Dr. Suess and Harry Potter magic at the library. He always had a theme. 
        He gave me my first magic kit. I used every single item until the ropes were frayed, the plastic chipped, and the coin holders missing. 
        I bought two more kits from Mike Dobias with the money I earned. I used the magic kits and a deck of cards for the close-up magic performance. 
    </p>

    <p>
        My parents went with me to Canada for the PCAM Magic Competition. I signed my name at check-in and received my performance time. 
        Each of us magicians had to hand in a form including any specific setup I wanted on stage, the props with my table, and music if I wanted to use it. 
        The first night was about socializing. 
        I met several award-winning magicians from around the world. I met Shawn Farquhar, two-time Grand Prix World Champion of Magic. 
        Shawn Farquhar has his own speakeasy in Canada called “Hidden Wonders”. He also has his own business producing magic tricks and props. 
        The first night of the magic competition had game night. 
        I spent my time at game night playing “Exploding Kittens”, a card game, with Shawn Farquhar. I also met Michael Dardant, 31-time medal winner, including World Champion (FISM in 2015). 
        He showed me several magic tricks and talked for a while. Michael Dardant was one of the speakers for the 3-day PCAM & SAM convention. 
        There were also many talented award-winning International Brotherhood of Magicians present.  
    </p>

    <p>
        The second day was the competition. I woke up very early. Too early. I practiced my magic until everyone was awake. 
        My little brother, Logan, woke up first. I performed for him a few times. Next, my mom woke up. I performed for her five or six times. 
        My Dad woke up last. I performed for him once and then we all went to breakfast. I had a chance to talk to all the other magicians. 
        Many of them performed magic at the table. A couple of teams were arranged for the dual magic bag competitions. 
        Winners won money. After breakfast, I went to a required check-in. 
        We went over the rules, talked to the MC Production crew to give specific instructions on music, placement of items on stage, and signals used to alert us to time constraints. 
    </p>


    <p>
        Around two, we started competitions. I waited outside the side stage door for the crew to call me backstage. 
        I was excited. I could feel my heart beating hard, energy was running through me, and I felt like I was about to run a race. 
        The crew hands came out into the hall and set me up with a professional headset microphone. All my props were already on stage. 
        I felt like a star going into the lights. 
    </p>

    <p>
        “Ladies, and gentlemen, boys, and girls, Welcome to The Magic of Devin Graupmann! My name is Devin Graupmann. 
        I will be performing The Lover’s Gift.”
        I walked away with two international medals from Pacific Coast Association of Magicians (PCAM) & The Society of American Magicians (SAM) competition. 
        One medal in stage magic and one medal in close-up magic.  
    </p>

    <p>

        Whenever, I want to celebrate my success, I go to the library. 
        I see all the award winners performing there who helped give me the confidence to go confidently in the direction of my dreams. 
        I’m still performing and have won 3 international medals. Being on stage is the highlight of my day!  
        There is a rush as I enter the lights, hear the crowds cheer, and know what I am doing makes people smile. It makes me smile too.
